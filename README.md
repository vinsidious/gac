## Features

- **LLM-Powered Commit Messages:** Automatically generates clear, concise, and context-aware commit messages using large language models.
- **Deep Contextual Analysis:** Understands your code by analyzing staged changes, repository structure, and recent commit history to provide highly relevant suggestions.
- **Multi-Provider & Model Support:** Flexibly works with various leading AI providers (like Anthropic, Cerebras, Groq, OpenRouter, OpenAI) and models, easily configured through an interactive setup or environment variables.
- **Seamless Git Workflow:** Integrates smoothly into your existing Git routine as a simple drop-in replacement for `git commit`.
- **Extensive Customization:** Tailor commit messages to your needs with a rich set of flags, including one-liners (`-o`), AI hints (`-h`), scope inference (`-s`), and specific model selection (`-m`).
- **Streamlined Workflow Commands:** Boost your productivity with convenient options to stage all changes (`-a`), auto-confirm commits (`-y`), and push to your remote repository (`-p`) in a single step.
- **Interactive Reroll with Feedback:** Not satisfied with the generated commit message? Use `r` for a simple regeneration, or `r <feedback>` to provide specific improvement suggestions (e.g., `r make it shorter`, `r focus on the bug fix`).
- **Token Usage Tracking:** Display token consumption statistics (prompt, completion, and total tokens).

## How It Works

gac analyzes your staged changes to generate high-quality commit messages with the help of large language models. The tool uses a sophisticated prompt architecture that separates system instructions from user data, enabling better AI understanding and more consistent results.

### Technical Architecture

- **Dual-Prompt System**: GAC uses a separated prompt architecture where system instructions (role definition, conventions, examples) are sent as system messages, while git data (diffs, status) are sent as user messages. This follows AI best practices for improved model performance.
- **Smart Context Analysis**: The tool examines your repository structure, recent commit history, and README files to understand the broader context of your changes.
- **Intelligent Diff Processing**: Large diffs are automatically preprocessed to focus on the most important changes while staying within token limits.

## How to Use

```sh
git add .
gac
```

## Installation and Configuration

### 1. Installation

#### Quick Try with uvx (no installation)

You can try gac without installing it using uvx:

```sh
# Try gac without installation
uvx gac --help

# Set up configuration (creates ~/.gac.env)
uvx gac init

# Use gac on staged changes
git add .
uvx gac
```

#### Permanent Installation

Install system-wide using pipx from the GitHub repository:

```sh
# Install pipx if you don't have it
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath

# Install gac
pipx install gac
```

Verify installation:

```sh
gac --version
```

### 2. Configuration

The recommended way to configure `gac` is using the interactive setup:

```sh
gac init
```

This command will guide you through selecting an AI provider, model, and securely entering your API keys. It will create or update a user-level configuration file at `$HOME/.gac.env`.

Example `$HOME/.gac.env` output:

```env
GAC_MODEL=anthropic:claude-3-5-haiku-latest
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
# Optional: configure OpenRouter
# GAC_MODEL=openrouter:openrouter/auto
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here
# OPENROUTER_SITE_URL=https://example.com
# OPENROUTER_SITE_NAME=Example App
```

Alternatively, you can configure `gac` using environment variables or by manually creating/editing the configuration file.

#### Managing Configuration with `gac config`

You can manage settings in your `$HOME/.gac.env` file using `gac config` commands:

- Show config: `gac config show`
- Set a value: `gac config set GAC_MODEL groq:meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`
- Get a value: `gac config get GAC_MODEL`
- Unset a value: `gac config unset GAC_MODEL`

### 3. Verify Setup

Test that `gac` is working properly with your configuration:

```sh
# Make a change to a file
echo "# Test change" >> README.md
git add README.md
gac -o # Generate a one-line commit message
```

You should see an AI-generated commit message.

### 4. Upgrade

To upgrade `gac` to the latest version, run:

```sh
pipx upgrade gac
```

## Basic Usage

Once installed and configured, using `gac` is straightforward:

1. Stage your changes:

   ```sh
   git add .
   ```

2. Run `gac`:

   ```sh
   gac
   ```

   This will generate a commit message for review. Confirm with `y` to accept the message.

### Common Commands

- Generate a commit message: `gac`
- Auto-accept the commit message: `gac -y`
- Stage all changes and generate a commit message: `gac -a`
- Generate a one-line commit message: `gac -o`
- Add a hint for the AI: `gac -h "Fixed the authentication bug"`
- Push the commit (requires accepting the commit message): `gac -p`
- Advanced usage: Add all, auto-confirm, push a one-liner with a hint: `gac -aypo -h "update for release"`

For a full list of CLI flags, advanced options, and example workflows, see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

## Best Practices

- gac loads configuration from two locations (in order of precedence):
  1. User-level `$HOME/.gac.env` (applies to all projects for the user)
  2. Project-level `.env` (in the project root, overrides user config if present) Environment variables always take final precedence over both files.
- Keep API keys out of version control
