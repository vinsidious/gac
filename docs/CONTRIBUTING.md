## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can accept your contribution, you need to sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This is a one-time
requirement that grants us the necessary rights to use and distribute your contributions while you retain ownership of
your work.

**How to sign the CLA:**

1. When you submit your first pull request, our CLA bot will automatically comment with instructions
2. Read the [CLA document](https://gist.github.com/cellwebb/1542fa5c0f6c59be6d1cb64ae985732e)
3. If you agree, comment on the PR with: `I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA`
4. The bot will then mark you as having signed, and your PR can proceed

The CLA only needs to be signed once and will apply to all your future contributions to this project.

## Coding Standards

- Target Python 3.13
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Keep code clean, compact, and readable
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Use logging instead of print statements
- Formatting is handled by `black`, `isort`, and `flake8` (max line length: 120)
- Write minimal, effective tests with `pytest`

## Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit to ensure code quality and consistency. The following hooks are configured:

- `black` - Code formatting
- `isort` - Import sorting
- `flake8` - Linting
- `markdownlint-cli2` - Markdown linting
- `prettier` - File formatting (markdown, yaml, json)

### Setup

1. Install pre-commit:

   ```sh
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. Install the git hooks:

   ```sh
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. (Optional) Run against all files:

   ```sh
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

The hooks will now run automatically on each commit. If any checks fail, you'll need to fix the issues before committing.

### Skipping Pre-commit Hooks

If you need to skip the pre-commit hooks temporarily, use the `--no-verify` flag:

```sh
git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message"
```

Note: This should only be used when absolutely necessary, as it bypasses important code quality checks.

## Testing Guidelines

The project uses pytest for testing. When adding new features or fixing bugs, please include tests that cover your
changes.

Note that the `scripts/` directory contains test scripts for functionality that cannot be easily tested with pytest.
Feel free to add scripts here for testing complex scenarios or integration tests that would be difficult to implement
using the standard pytest framework.

### Running Tests

```sh
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_prompt.py

# Run specific test
python -m pytest tests/test_prompt.py::TestExtractRepositoryContext::test_extract_repository_context_with_docstring
```

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. Harassment or abusive behavior will not be tolerated.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project.
