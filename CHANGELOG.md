# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [TODO]

- A cleaner approach would be to reorganize the modules by extracting a core domain layer separate from utility
  functions, reducing cross-module dependencies.
- Enhance Test Coverage for Complex Functionality: The project needs more comprehensive tests for core features like
  error handling in generate_commit_message(), edge cases in error classification logic, and complete verification of
  the multi-level configuration system to ensure robustness in real-world scenarios.
- Key redaction: Add key redaction to sensitive data in logs and error messages.
- Large repo optimization: Optimize handling of large repositories with many files and directories.
- Error handling enhancement: Improve error messages and classification logic.
- Quick start guide: Add a quick start guide for new users.
- Document configuration precedence and best practices.
- Document real-world usage patterns and best practices.
- Choose a commit to git diff against
- Add recent git commit messages as context? If so, probably need to add a flag to control the number of commits to
  include
